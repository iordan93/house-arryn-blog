# Demo Application
Here is the repository for the demo application we created: [https://github.com/iordan93/JSAppDemo](https://github.com/iordan93/JSAppDemo). Run it with Visual Studio (you only need to press (Ctrl + ) F5). Without rinning the project, the server will not be available and no requests would be accepted. Then you can start the Demo.Client index.html file in your browser normally.

You can find the API endpoints (routes) in the API link at the top of the server page.

Also, Visual Studio will ask you to load the *packages* for the project - just allow it to do this :).

*Note:* VS can be a little slow when you debug the application, so be patient please :).
